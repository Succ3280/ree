    <h1>Ali Cross Passion Project</h1>
    <p id="date"></p>
    <ul>
        <li class="list">This project is by Memphis Thalman</li>
        <li class="list">The book I'm doing is Ali Cross</li>
        <li>And it is written by James Patterson</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.6.3</h1>  
    <p>This part of of the project is where I explain how the plot unfolds and how the characters respond to it. So I am going to do that. The plot unfolds in kind of way where it lays out everything that's going on in the story. For example the book starts off where Ali Cross's dad, Alex Cross, get sued for accidentaly assaulting an acussed criminal. Then Ali's best friend Gabe goes missing. So Ali goes on an investigation to find him.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile around Christmas their house gets robbed by what it seems to be Gabe and someone else. Alex and Ali are both detectives but Ali is not a REAL detective yet. Alex finds out that Ali might be on to something with Gabe's case and the robbery of his home. Over the course of Ali trying to find Gabe he acts up and gets into a suprising fight! (Go read the book for more climax).</p>
    <p>Anyways the characters respond to plot by moving on, even though there are some bumps here and there. Actually it looked terrible for the Crosses because the assualt charges had a lot of evidence and nobody had seen Gabe anywhere. I'll spoil the ending and say that Gabe did actually get forced into robbing Ali's house by his father and his brother. Ali and Gabe communcated secretly over a game called Outpost. Good news is that Gabe is safe now.</p>
    <p>Well anyways I worked hard for this project and i hope you like it!</p>
